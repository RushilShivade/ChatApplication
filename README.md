# ChatApplication
A chat application created using ReactJS and Socket.io Library

This application was made to learn the [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) library. 

Socket.IO is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between a web browser (client) and a web server. It provides an abstraction layer on top of traditional WebSocket technology and offers additional features to simplify real-time communication. Socket.IO supports both server-side (Node.js) and client-side (browser) implementations.

On the landing page, you have to specify your name and the room ID after which you'll be directed to the chat page.

If you run the app on a new tab, join the same room ID, you'll be able to send and receive messages with the help of socket.io
